/**
 * LockingCacheInterface
 *
 * Extension of the PSR-16 CacheInterface that provides a small lock API
 * suitable for file-based or simple distributed cache implementations which
 * want to offer basic lock acquisition/release semantics.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - These methods are optional — a standard PSR-16 implementation does not
 *   have to implement them.
 * - acquireLock should return an opaque "token" string when the lock was
 *   successfully obtained, or null when the lock could not be acquired.
 * - releaseLock must be called with the same token that acquireLock returned.
 * - TTL is a recommended expiry for the lock; implementations should treat
 *   expired locks as stale and allow a reclaim attempt.
 *
 * Rationale: this tiny extension is useful when you need a simple synchronization
 * primitive (for example: token refresh coordination) but don't want to depend
 * on external lock providers. For multi-host production usage consider robust
 * providers (Redis, Zookeeper, or Symfony Lock).
 *
 * @internal Keep this in your libs/ directory or a small shared package.

     * Implementations should perform an atomic acquisition (e.g. fopen('x')
     * on a lock file, or SET NX in Redis). On success, return an opaque token

     *
     * If the lock is not available (held by another process), return null.
     * If the lock file exists but is stale (expired), an implementation may
     * remove it and retry acquiring once.
     *

     * prefer returning null. Exceptions may be used for fatal errors (I/O,
